My personal notes for the direction of the site:

#### jan 1, 2026

I have a few ideas for domain names but I think I can wait until I have finished the site
Most portfolio websites have these base pages: Home, About, Projects. An optional page is Experiences, but that is sometimes put under About or Projects
These sites also have a resume pdf download button somewhere. Will need a new resume tailored to engineering-related things.

Background theme idea: 
    background a big invisible grid, blocks jump from one to the next in finite lines and different colours. If a block hits a grid square of a different colour (most will be blank), then it too changes colours. This could be implemented programmatically. Not sure about performance impacts but it would be really cool. Kind of like watching a factorio factory (but much less complex) or that one block factory game.
     - Can also have option for light and dark mode, just with different colour schemes

Foreground:
    Just a simple information panel. Takes up a block in the middle of the page so the background can still be seen. Floating windows can popup for other infos


Mobile:
   Tablets:
      Keep same animations, buttons, and colour schemes, but just formatted properly for the screen size
   Phones:
    Can just be a simple portfolio site with the same colour scheme as the rest. No need to too many complex animations
